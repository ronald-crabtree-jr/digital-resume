I'm Ronald Crabtree, an Electrical Engineering graduate with a strong foundation in power systems, embedded design, and digital systems — with additional graduate-level training in computer science.

My academic experience includes transformer and generator modeling, embedded development on Raspberry Pi and FPGA platforms, and real-time data processing using Verilog, C++, and OpenCV. I’ve worked on projects involving multithreaded image preprocessing, FPGA-based datapaths, and sensor fusion for autonomous systems. I’m especially interested in power system efficiency, smart grid technology, and embedded solutions that combine hardware and software to solve real-world problems.

Before engineering, I served in law enforcement, where I earned top honors (Top-Cop; Top-Shot; Top-Academic) and led high-pressure investigations. That experience shaped my mindset: I stay calm under pressure, take initiative, and lead with discipline and clarity.

I’m now seeking opportunities in the power industry, embedded systems, or multidisciplinary teams at the intersection of hardware and intelligent systems — with a long-term goal of contributing to the smart power grid and advanced energy systems.
